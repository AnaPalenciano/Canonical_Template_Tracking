# Canonical Template Tracking

Template scripts to perform a Canonical Template Tracking (CTT) analysis on fMRI data using The Decoding Toolbox (Hebart, GÃ¶rgen & Haynes, 2015). 
Two template tracking methods are provided: correlation-based distance and multiple regression. 
A simulated dataset (generated with the RSA Toolbox; Nili et al. 2014) is also provided.
